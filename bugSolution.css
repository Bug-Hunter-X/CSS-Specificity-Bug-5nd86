This updated CSS code resolves the specificity issue by either making the `.box` selector more specific or by using the `!important` flag (though generally `!important` should be avoided as much as possible).  The preferred approach is to reorganize your selectors for improved clarity and avoid overriding styles unintentionally. 

Solution 1 (More Specific Selector):
```css
#container {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

#container .box {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.box {
  background-color: lightblue;
  /* This rule will now apply to .box elements outside #container*/
}
```

Solution 2 (Using !important - Less Recommended):
```css
#container {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.box {
  background-color: lightblue !important;
}

#container .box {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
